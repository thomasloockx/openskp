## 🌟 What is OpenSKP?

OpenSKP is the **first and only** open-source, cross-platform parser for SketchUp (`.skp`) binary files. Built entirely through reverse engineering of SketchUp's binary formats — both the modern **VFF container** (2021+) and the classic **MFC `CArchive`** container (2013–2020) — it gives you full programmatic access to 3D models — geometry, materials, components, layers, and more — without requiring the SketchUp application or its proprietary SDK, in **Python, TypeScript, .NET, Dart, and C++**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was built by reverse engineering a proprietary binary format. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Trimble Inc. or SketchUp.

## 🏭 Used in Production

OpenSKP isn't just a library — it's the SketchUp-parsing engine behind real, actively-used production applications:

|:--------|:-------------|:---------------------|
| <img width="82" height="69" alt="image" src="https://frame-smart.com/assets/img/logo.svg" /> [FrameSmart](https://frame-smart.com/) | A 3D collaboration platform for viewing, sharing, and collaborating on 3D models together with their metadata (IFC, SketchUp, and more) — hosted on Linux, with nearly 200 active users. | Powers FrameSmart's entire SketchUp import pipeline, end to end. |

## 🖥️ Platform Support

| Platform | Version | Status | Install | Package Link |
|:---------|:--------|:------:|:--------|:-------------|
| 🐍 **Python** | `v0.3.0` | ✅ Available | `pip install openskp` | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openskp/) |
| 📘 **TypeScript / JS** | `v0.3.0` | ✅ Available | `npm install openskp` | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openskp) |
| 🚀 **.NET / C#** | `v0.3.0` | ✅ Available | `dotnet add package OpenSkp` | [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenSkp) |
| 🎯 **Dart / Flutter** | `v0.3.0` | ✅ Available | `dart pub add openskp` | [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/openskp) |
| ⚙️ **C++17** | `v0.3.0` | ✅ Source package | `find_package(OpenSkp CONFIG REQUIRED)` | [`packages/cpp`](packages/cpp) |

All five languages parse both the modern VFF (2021+) and classic MFC
(2013–2020) `.skp` containers, and support the same opt-in scene-baking
(`buildScene()`) and observability APIs. See the
[Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for the full picture, including
where the five ports currently differ.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Pick your language — every sample below runs against the current public
API (verified while writing this README). For the full picture (the
opt-in `buildScene()` step for triangulated meshes, memory/performance
guidance, progress + error observability, legacy-format support), see the
**[Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)**.

### 🐍 Python

```bash
pip install openskp
```

```python
from openskp import SkpFile

model = SkpFile.open("my_model.skp").parse()

print(f"SketchUp version: {model.version}")
print(f"Layers: {[l.name for l in model.layers]}")

for def_id, defn in model.definitions.items():
    if not isinstance(def_id, int):
        continue  # skip the implicit 'ROOT' entry
    print(f"{defn.name}: {len(defn.vertices)} verts, {len(defn.faces)} faces")

for material in model.materials:
    print(f"Material: {material.name}", "(has texture)" if material.texture else "")

# Opt-in: full placed scene graph, triangulated, world-space, GLB-ready
scene = SkpFile.open("my_model.skp").build_scene()
print(f"{len(scene.glb_primitives)} renderable mesh primitives")
```

### 📘 TypeScript / JavaScript

```bash
npm install openskp
```

```typescript
import { SkpFile, toGLB } from 'openskp';

// Node.js
const model = SkpFile.open('my_model.skp').parse();

// Browser (isomorphic - same package, no Node APIs)
// const buffer = await fetch('my_model.skp').then(r => r.arrayBuffer());
// const model = parseSkp(buffer);

console.log(model.version, model.layers);

// Opt-in: full placed scene graph, triangulated, world-space, GLB-ready
const scene = SkpFile.open('my_model.skp').buildScene();
const glb = toGLB(scene);   // ready to write to a .glb file
```

### 🚀 .NET / C#

```bash
dotnet add package OpenSkp
```

```csharp
using OpenSkp;

var model = SkpFile.Open("my_model.skp");
Console.WriteLine($"{model.Version} - {model.Layers.Count} layers");

// Opt-in: full placed scene graph, triangulated, world-space, GLB-ready
var scene = SkpFile.BuildScene("my_model.skp");
Console.WriteLine($"{scene.GlbPrimitives.Count} renderable mesh primitives");
```

### 🎯 Dart / Flutter

```bash
dart pub add openskp
```

```dart
import 'package:openskp/openskp.dart';

final model = SkpFile.open('my_model.skp').parse();
print('${model.version} - ${model.layers.length} layers');

// Opt-in: full placed scene graph, triangulated, world-space, GLB-ready
final scene = SkpFile.open('my_model.skp').buildScene();
print('${scene.glbPrimitives.length} renderable mesh primitives');
```

### ⚙️ C++17 / CMake

```cmake
find_package(OpenSkp CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE OpenSkp::OpenSkp)
```

```cpp
#include <openskp/openskp.hpp>

auto skp = openskp::SkpFile::open("my_model.skp");
auto model = skp.parse();
auto scene = skp.build_scene();
auto glb = openskp::to_glb(scene);
openskp::export_glb(scene, "my_model.glb");
```

---

## 🏛️ Architecture

OpenSKP splits into a light parse and an opt-in, heavier scene bake — kept
separate so the common case (just reading geometry/metadata) never pays for
scene-graph resolution it doesn't need:

```mermaid
graph TB
    SKP[".skp file<br/>(VFF 2021+ or legacy MFC 2013-2020)"] --> HDR["Header + container<br/>detection"]
    HDR --> WALK["Streaming TLV walk<br/>(one top-level record<br/>at a time)"]
    WALK --> RAW["Raw parsed data<br/>defs · layers · materials · styles"]
    RAW --> PARSE["parse() -> SkpModel<br/>per-definition geometry,<br/>no scene resolution"]
    RAW --> SCENE["buildScene() -> Scene<br/>full placed instance tree,<br/>triangulated, world-space"]
    SCENE --> GLB["GLB export<br/>(Python + TypeScript + C++)"]

    style SKP fill:#f59e0b,color:#000,stroke:#d97706
    style RAW fill:#8b5cf6,color:#fff,stroke:#7c3aed
    style PARSE fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff,stroke:#2563eb
    style SCENE fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff,stroke:#2563eb
    style GLB fill:#10b981,color:#fff,stroke:#059669
```

The streaming TLV walk is what lets OpenSKP handle real production files
with 100,000+ component definitions without materializing the whole file's
parse tree in memory at once — peak memory is bounded by the single
largest top-level record, not the file's total size.

> internals map to each other — see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🔬 How It Works

SketchUp `.skp` files use a proprietary binary format called **VFF** (introduced in SketchUp 2021). Here's how OpenSKP reads them:

### 1. Header Validation
Every SKP file starts with a magic marker (`FF FE FF 0E`) followed by a UTF-16LE version string. OpenSKP validates this header to confirm format compatibility.

### 2. ZIP Extraction
The SKP file is a ZIP archive (following the header). Inside, you'll find:
- **`model.dat`** — The binary geometry payload (TLV-encoded)
- **`materials/*/material.xml`** — Material definitions and textures
- **`meta/*.png`** — Thumbnails and preview images

### 3. TLV Parsing
The `model.dat` binary uses **Tag-Length-Value (TLV)** encoding:
- **Tag**: 2-byte identifier (little-endian)
- **Length**: 4-byte payload size (little-endian)
- **Value**: Raw bytes of the specified length

Some tags are *containers* — their payload is a sequence of nested TLV elements, forming a tree structure.

### 4. Model Construction
OpenSKP maps known tags to geometry primitives, component hierarchies, layers, and materials to build a structured, queryable model object.

### 5. Coordinate Conversion
SketchUp uses a **Z-up, inches** coordinate system. When exporting to glTF (which uses Y-up, meters), OpenSKP applies:

```
x_mm =  x_inches × 25.4
y_mm =  z_inches × 25.4
z_mm = -y_inches × 25.4
```

> 📖 The above covers the modern VFF (2021+) container. Pre-2021 files use a
> completely different container (a classic MFC `CArchive` object-graph
> stream, no ZIP involved) — OpenSKP detects and handles both
> transparently behind the same `parse()` call. See
> [the Developer Guide's legacy-format section](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#legacy-format-support-sketchup-20132020)
> for details, and [docs/BINARY_FORMAT.md](docs/BINARY_FORMAT.md) for the
> full VFF/TLV specification.
